# cub3d
Cub3D focuses on creating a simple 3D game engine from scratch using the C programming language. The goal of the project is to introduce students to the fundamentals of raycasting, a technique used to render a 3D environment on a 2D screen.

Students are tasked with implementing various features of the game engine, including handling user input for player movement, rendering walls, floors, and ceilings using raycasting techniques, and adding textures to surfaces. The project also involves parsing a configuration file to define the layout of the game's map and specifying textures and other settings.

Overall, "cub3D" provides students with a hands-on opportunity to gain experience with low-level programming, graphics rendering, and game development concepts. It's a challenging yet rewarding project that helps students develop their skills in software engineering and computer graphics.
